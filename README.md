ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Hyewon Jeong! @mandiehyewon, a Ph.D. student at EECS/CSAIL/IMES MIT. My research interest is in Machine Learning for Healthcare, specifically focusing on leveraging time-series (tabular, signal datasets) and multi-modal datasets to build rich representations of real-world datasets.

If you have any cool ideas for collaboration or questions, please don't hesitate to get in touch with me here: hyewonj@mit.edu. Thanks!
